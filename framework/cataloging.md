## Cataloging

Choice if using catalogIt

### Data structures in CatalogIt 

- from objects that have places to detailed place-related metadata

Prototype variants: 

- object types and mediums: sculpture, accessories, magazine clipping, key, glass, *Thobe* (dress) and chest panels, dishes
- geographies:
  - Palestine: levels of precision → village, area, city, region, ... up to somewhere in pre-1948 Palestine
  - Diaspora: specific (ex: refugee Camp in Lebanon) or uncertain (up to anywhere in the world)
- dates: 
  - varying levels of time period precision: Uncertain (19th-20th century, or 20th century), decade (ex: 1950s-1960s), specific time period (ex: 1982-1984,1960-1962
- makers
  - known
  - not known
  - known but anonymous

### Expressing/embracing uncertainty

**BWB** data challenges

- mapping → areas instead of dots
  - center of Palestine location 
  - how do we map objects made by the diaspora → symbol for diaspora (globe & palestinian icon)
  - two approaches: mapping all the data vs bespoke StoryMaps
- dates → timeframe instead of a specific year?
  - how to produce a "time-aware map" and take the viewer through space & time
  - accuracy vs storytelling, basemap vs StoryMap context
  - thinking in terms of intervals? (anything that could have been during x and y)

Choosing discoverability over uncertainty <!--sort of a turn on accuracy...need to discuss it with Wafa-->: lack of specific knowledge shouldn't make stories and objects invisible. Using uncertainty as when casting a wider net, making things more visible on the map.
