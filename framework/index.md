## Project aim and context 

This practical « literature review » is a derived research outcome from the [*Bayt wa Balad* bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6331652/bayt-wa-balad/library). By highlighting key references we found in the literature, it aims to point out good practices that apply to our approach, and identify challenges we might encounter in the making of *Bayt wa Balad*.
