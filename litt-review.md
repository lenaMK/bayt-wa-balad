# Litt review and mapping guidelines

 

## Project aim and context 

This practical « litterature review » <!--is this the corrrect term to describe what we are doing?--> is a derived research outcome from the [*Bayt wa Balad* bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6331652/bayt-wa-balad/library). By highlighting key references we found in the literature, it aims to point out good practices that apply to our approach, and identify challenges we might encounter in the making of *Bayt wa Balad*.



### *Bayt wa Balad*

[remix from diverse BWBxMPP documents]

*Bayt wa Balad* is a digital mapping initiative led by the Museum of Palestinian People (Washington D.C.) and funded by the Mellon Foundation. It is dedicated to preserving and documenting Palestinian cultural heritage from the diaspora. Through the lens of history, whether ancient or contemporary, the museum’s collection becomes a vessel for storytelling, resilience, and the preservation of identity—offering a space where heritage is not only remembered but actively reclaimed in the face of erasure.

This project integrates technology, historical research, and storytelling to document and visualize displaced and destroyed Palestinian cultural heritage through an interactive map. It begins by furthering research into the museum’s collection, documenting each object within its original geography, maker history, and cultural context, if possible. Using the research data, each object is then mapped from where it was made, to how it reached the diaspora, providing vital insight into the exile of objects as a way to visualize and learn about the exile of the Palestinian people, and the various paths each person and family has taken. Through the lens of history, whether ancient or contemporary, the museum’s collection becomes a vessel for storytelling, resilience, and the preservation of identity—offering a space where heritage is not only remembered but actively reclaimed in the face of erasure.

The resulting work will be made publicly accessible through an interactive digital platform. In resisting deliberate erasure in the United States, the museum stands in solidarity with Palestinian cultural institutions worldwide, serving as a testament to the unyielding spirit of a people whose history is inscribed in art, collective memory, and the land itself.

### Litterature review production and positionality

This litterature review is initiated by Lena MK, as external collaborator of the *Bayt wa Balad* team. It will be shaped and enhanced collectively, in order to provide guidelines and references that situate the *Bayt wa Balad* within scientific litterature and a panorama of cultural mapping / digital collections projects.

Directions

- when possible, focusing on palestinian perspective but also including other references so as to have an overview of the processes in knowledge production
- informed by the positionalities of the team: 
  - disciplines and specialties
  - formal and informal networks of individuals, researchers, professionals and institutions
  - research context (ex: Turtle Island → deconial approaches), relation to locations: Montréal, Washington D.C.,  Palestine
- open and ongoing
