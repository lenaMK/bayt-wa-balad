## Cataloging (geo-)narratives

### Cataloging object biographies

Background: Wafa's research

Palestinian museum collection





### Expressing/embracing uncertainty

**BWB** data challenges

- mapping → areas instead of dots
  - center of Palestine location 
  - how do we map objects made by the diaspora → symbol for diaspora (globe & palestinian icon)
  - two approaches: mapping all the data vs bespoke StoryMaps
- dates → timeframe instead of a specific year?
  - how to produce a "time-aware map" and take the viewer through space & time
  - accuracy vs storytelling, basemap vs StoryMap context
  - thinking in terms of intervals? (anything that could have been during x and y)

Choosing discoverability over uncertainty <!--sort of a turn on accuracy...need to discuss it with Wafa-->: lack of specific knowledge shouldn't make stories and objects invisible. Using uncertainty as when casting a wider net, making things more visible on the map.



Visualizing Palestine

> - What approaches render the scale of violations legible, while honoring the specificity of people’s individual stories?
> - What are the limitis of our imagination and visual vocabulary in demonstrating systems of oppression that have been purposely designed to be invisible, fragmented, and opaque? 
> - How do we navigate gaps in the data, and truths that cannot be measured or counted?
> - And how can our knowledge effectively support transformative action?
