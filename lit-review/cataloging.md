## Cataloging (geo-)narratives

### Cataloging object biographies

Background: Wafa's research

Palestinian museum collection





### Expressing/embracing uncertainty

**BWB** data challenges

- mapping → areas instead of dots
  - center of Palestine location 
  - how do we map objects made by the diaspora → symbol for diaspora (globe & palestinian icon)
  - two approaches: mapping all the data vs bespoke StoryMaps
- dates → timeframe instead of a specific year?
  - how to produce a "time-aware map" and take the viewer through space & time
  - accuracy vs storytelling, basemap vs StoryMap context
  - thinking in terms of intervals? (anything that could have been during x and y)

Choosing discoverability over uncertainty <!--sort of a turn on accuracy...need to discuss it with Wafa-->: lack of specific knowledge shouldn't make stories and objects invisible. Using uncertainty as when casting a wider net, making things more visible on the map.
