## Literature review aim and context 

This practical « literature review » is a derived research outcome from the [*Bayt wa Balad* bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6331652/bayt-wa-balad/library). By highlighting key references we found in the literature, it aims to point out good practices that apply to our approach, and identify challenges we might encounter in the making of *Bayt wa Balad*.

The review is structured around key topics in the making of *Bayt wa Balad*, divided into three themes: 

- [Mapping](./lit-review/mapping)
  - Mapping and counter-mapping practices
  - Thinking across histories and geographies
  - Place names
  - Existing maps, data portals and other sources
- [Cataloging](./lit-review/cataloging)
  - Cataloging object biographies
  - Expressing/embracing uncertainty
- [Storytelling](./lit-review/storytelling)
  - Palestinian narratives
  - Story Maps
  - Digital collections and exhibitions



### Literature review production and positionality

This literature review is initiated by Lena MK, as external collaborator of the *Bayt wa Balad* team. It will be shaped and enhanced collectively, in order to provide guidelines and references that situate the *Bayt wa Balad* within scientific literature and a panorama of cultural mapping / digital collections projects. As the project is centered on narrating a Palestinian experience, the review was compiled accordingly to focus primarily on Palestinian perspective.

Other references have been included (many are documented in the bibliography) so as to have an overview of the processes in knowledge production. It has been informed by the positionalities of the team, such as their disciplines and specialties, but also they many formal and informal networks of individuals, researchers, professionals and institutions they are embedded with. The research context provides additional perspectives, from Turtle Island, Montréal, Washington D.C. (and more), and in the relationships each member sustains with Palestine.

The literature review is currently an open and ongoing process. Contributions are welcome, and will be integrated to the best of the team's capacity.

For now, the writing style is aimed at practical use, therefore minimally stitching together notes, excepts, questions, and comments that arose from the topic. A textual narrative form is considered for later publication.
