## Visual and cartographic storytelling



### Palestinian narratives

Visualizing Palestine → provide a brief template in the Annex

- focus on shifting narratives, recognizing that Palestine has been the subject of a century of colonial narratives designed to obscure, justify, and perpetuate oppression (p.2)
- create visual stories to nourish education, advocacy, organizing, and collective action for Palestinian liberation (p.2)



“storytelling through poetry and art is the only remaining tool for narrating the violent distortion and transfiguration of humanity” (Anani, 2020, p. 6)



### Story Maps

Inspiration/notes from [storyMaps examples](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6331652/bayt-wa-balad/collections/D5SXEIE6/collection)



### Digital collections and exhibitions

#### Inspiration/notes from digital collections 

**Digital Benin**

Portal with many entry points into the contents and the stories (ex: Oral history), similar topic of cultural object diaspora, decolonial museology, etc.

Inspiration for the **BWB** portal

- note: distinguish uses for the touch screen in the museum vs web access
- BWB is centered on the MPP's collection, but DigitalBenin could serve as a reference as a plateform that points to many resources/objects that are elsewhere: linking, referencing, including through collaboration or open use → as a way to point to the many other ressources on Palestinian culture and history

#### Inspiration/notes from digital exhibitions

### Mesopotamia

Getty digital exhibit <!-- note a certain irony in using this example-->

Inspiration: 

- Consider a StoryMap where the basemap is the object, ex: a dress, and tell its story by navigating towards different sections of it. The maps become an overlay, perhaps in a smaller frame, while the object is the center of the story
