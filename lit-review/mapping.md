## Mapping Palestine

> […] during the early 1960s when I was browsing the maps in the Royal Geographical Society, the British Library, the National Archives (known as the Public Records Office then), the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF), and other libraries[,] I did not fine the name “Palestine” anywhere […] The librarians directed me to the name “Israel”. There I found the Palestine maps of the British Mandate with the name “Palestine” crossed out and “Israel” written instead. It was like an armed robber breaking into the house and then replacing the nameplate on the door. (Abu Sitta 2016, 269-270)

Hence we begin with the same question as Hashem Abushama « How do we locate Palestine on the map? » (2025, p. 1), to consider which maps and mapping practices we want learn (or stay away) from

### Situating Palestine across histories and geographies

> « There exist multiple Palestinian geographies  […] All of these geographies are entangled with and directly and indirectly shaped by settler colonial logics of elimination, fragmentation, segregation, and corporeal violence » (Abushama, 2025, p. 4)

The brief article by Zena Agha, James Esson, Mark Griffiths, et Mikko Jorone (2024) retraces the colonial histories of Palestine and shares abundant references.

- It was written to « situate and contextualise the ongoing military assault on Gaza within longer colonial histories in Palestine; » (Agha et al., 2024, p. 1)
- It outlines how current assaults in Gaza are a « continuation of a long history of European colonialism in the region, influenced particularly by British colonialism and its facilitation of the Zionist movement's desire to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine through various means, including the ‘fostering of Jewish national sentiment’ and the ‘promotion of the colonisation of Palestine’, » (Agha et al., 2024, p. 2)
- « In 1917, the year Britain gained control of Palestine, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, which facilitated the establishment of ‘a national home for the Jewish people’. As Edward Said (1979, pp. 15–16) wrote, the declaration was made by a European power about non-European territory in disregard of the presence and wishes of the native majority while promising the territory they inhabited to another foreign group » (Agha et al., 2024, p. 3)
- Summary overview of the Nakba (useful recap & necessary for audience that might not know the term): « In the process and in the months before statehood, Zionist militias forcibly displaced and destroyed around 500 Palestinian villages (and 11 urban neighbourhoods) across Palestine. Their inhabitants—over 700,000 Palestinians—became refugees in neighbouring Arab countries (including what became known as the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip) with no right to return to their homes and lands, while around 15,000 Palestinians were killed by Zionist militias (which after 1948 formed the Israel Defence Forces) (Falah, 1996). To Palestinians, this is known as the Nakba, or ‘catastrophe’. » (Agha et al., 2024, p. 3)

### Place names



> These names [place names] are the vocabulary of Palestinian social history, carved out by Palestinians in their daily routine, describing their life, their history, and their land, speaking to them in Arabic […] Place names etch the geography and history of the people, as the people saw them. 
>
> These names honor family; they refer to ‘Abu’, ‘Umm’, ‘Ibn’, ‘Bint’, almost three thousand times. They relate to a place with particular features, such as ‘Umm al-Shuqaf’, the place with pottery. They indicate ownership: Ali’s garden, Hussein’s field. They spcify what is planted in the fields: olives, grapes, figs. They signify places where certain animals are common: horses, camels, gazelles, worlves, foxes, or birds – *hamam* (pigeons) and falcons. They paint the colors of the land and types of terrain: red, yellow, hills, cliff, and meadows. The point to the wells, springs, and ponds. The names inform us of the background of the farmer: ‘Akkawi’, ‘Ghazzawi’, ‘Durzi’, and ‘Nasrani.’ They refer to the relative location of the village: lower, upper, or in-between (*tahta, fawqa, bayna*). The names share special events: the horses’ birthplace, the killing site of the chief, the hanging site, the battle scene. They have strange names such as ‘going up and down’, ‘the good name’, ‘good morning’, ‘the morning star’, ‘shield protector’, ‘wolf’s face’, or ‘dog’s tail.’(Abu Sitta 2016, 273)

### Mapping and counter-mapping practices



#### deconstructing / (re-)accessing historical maps

Collins-Kreiner, Noga. 2015. « Maps and Meaning: Reading the Map of the Holy Land ». *The Qualitative Report*, advance online publication, janvier 20. https://doi.org/10.46743/2160-3715/2005.1849.

Analysis of 101 national maps of the area, that were on sale from 1994 to 2001.

- « The power of maps in the formulation of foreign policy is reflected in the scale adopted, the semantics and naming of places, and the extent to which they are utilized as part of a wider process of cartographic propaganda and territorial socialization » (Collins-Kreiner, 2015, p. 259)
- « each map distorts reality in one way or another. Wood (1993, p. 70) claimed that maps work by serving interests and “Every map shows this.... but not that”. But because all maps distort, what is important is the intention behind the construction of the map and the use to which it is put » (Collins-Kreiner, 2015, p. 260)
- « in the case of Israel, presentation of the present and future boundaries play an important part in the propaganda of the major parties » (Collins-Kreiner, 2015, p. 260)
- « Most of the maps of this sort [« Holy Christian » narrative, *a category in their study*] ignored the state of Israel, a surprising circumstance considering that most of the maps were produced in Israel. » (Collins-Kreiner, 2015, p. 266) « They disregarded various political facts, such as cease-fire lines and border crossing points. They contained no political-textual or symbolic information, but they were replete with religious symbols and information » (Collins-Kreiner, 2015, p. 266-267)
- « The frame imparts a colourful and attractive appearance to the map » (Collins-Kreiner, 2015, p. 268) considering a frame → how we want to frame our map(s). The frame provides context, situates the map
- « Maps with the name Palestine in the title emphasized the political existence of the Palestinian people. » (Collins-Kreiner, 2015, p. 270) « The map’s title and content made a statement about the ownership of the land » (Collins-Kreiner, 2015, p. 270) « Two main types of maps of Palestine were found: (1) “Greater Palestine”: maps that eliminated Israel altogether and presented the whole region as a Palestinian state and (2) “Smaller Palestine”: maps that presented the areas under the Palestine National Authority as a Palestinian state » (Collins-Kreiner, 2015, p. 270)
- « The basic message to emerge from the Palestinian maps was a wish to project the existence of a “Palestinian state” narrative: This minimizes Israeli control over the region or completely eliminates it and stresses the existence of the Palestinian nation » (Collins-Kreiner, 2015, p. 271)

No maps in arabic → the scope of our research should, if possible, be wider, to include an analysis of maps in arabic → ex: Çelik, Zeynep, et Zeinab Azarbadegan. 2020. « Late Ottoman Visions of Palestine: Railroads, Maps, and Aerial Photography ». *Jerusalem Quarterly*, no 82 (juin): 87. https://doi.org/10.70190/jq.I82.p87.

#### Counter-mapping

Abushama, Hashem. 2025. « Mapping and Countermapping Dispossession in Palestine ». *Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers* 50 (1): e12708. https://doi.org/10.1111/tran.12708.

- « how do you map Palestine under Israeli settler colonialism? » (Abushama, 2025, p. 2)
- « If dominant colonial maps are about the neat packaging of lived realities into dominant spatio-temporal demarcations, counter-maps are about highlighting the ghostly stories and embodied spatial practices and processes of living within and beyond such demarcations. » (Abushama, 2025, p. 1)
- counter-mapping […] 
  - refers to the practices and processes of producing maps that challenge systems of oppression and exploitation (Abushama, 2025, p. 2)
  - brings into question the distance between reality and representation where power lies (Abushama, 2025, p. 2)
  - « Counter-mapping is a material practice of weaving together neglected and unintelligible histories, visuals, ideas, faces, alleyways, and embodied spatial practices » (Abushama, 2025, p. 2)

- « The counter-map [by Haya Zaatry] insists on a triangular prism through which the layers of dispossession are refracted once the light of critical inquiry passes through—the light that sees and recognises the stories of the dispossessed while clinging to a rigorous analysis of the systems of oppression and exploitation that enable and perpetuate dispossession » (Abushama, 2025, p. 3)
- « Such is the task of countermapping in a context of dispossession: to bring into sharp relief both the complex systems of oppression and exploitation that dispossess communities as well as the spatial practices and processes of living within and at the limits of such systems » (Abushama, 2025, p. 6)

### Existing maps, data portals and other sources

Palestine Open Maps

### Considerations for the *Bayt wa Balad* base map

" Roads, as Salamanca (2020) argues, are part of a wider project of dispossession that serves the long-term domination of the settlers." (Abushama, Hashem. 2024. “A Map without Guarantees: Stuart Hall and Palestinian Geographies.” *Stuart Hall Foundation*. Accessed January 21, 2026. https://www.stuarthallfoundation.org/resource/a-map-without-guarantees-stuart-hall-and-palestinian-geographies/.)

- consider if roads are meaningful in *Bayt wa Balad*, whether their presence in the map can support a Palestinian narrative?
