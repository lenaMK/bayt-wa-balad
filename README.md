Contributions to [*Bayt wa Balad* (‫وبلد‬ ‫بيت‬): The Palestinian Cultural Mapping Project](https://mpp-dc.org/baytwabalad/), a digital initiative from the [Museum of the Palestinian People](https://mpp-dc.org).

### [About the project](./about)

*Bayt wa Balad* is a digital mapping initiative led by the Museum of Palestinian People (Washington D.C.) and funded by the Mellon Foundation. It is dedicated to preserving and documenting Palestinian cultural heritage from the diaspora. Through the lens of history, whether ancient or contemporary, the museum’s collection becomes a vessel for storytelling, resilience, and the preservation of identity—offering a space where heritage is not only remembered but actively reclaimed in the face of erasure.

This project integrates technology, historical research, and storytelling to document and visualize displaced and destroyed Palestinian cultural heritage through an interactive map. It begins by furthering research into the museum’s collection, documenting each object within its original geography, maker history, and cultural context, if possible. Using the research data, each object is then mapped from where it was made, to how it reached the diaspora, providing vital insight into the exile of objects as a way to visualize and learn about the exile of the Palestinian people, and the various paths each person and family has taken. Through the lens of history, whether ancient or contemporary, the museum’s collection becomes a vessel for storytelling, resilience, and the preservation of identity—offering a space where heritage is not only remembered but actively reclaimed in the face of erasure.

The resulting work will be made publicly accessible through an interactive digital platform. In resisting deliberate erasure in the United States, the museum stands in solidarity with Palestinian cultural institutions worldwide, serving as a testament to the unyielding spirit of a people whose history is inscribed in art, collective memory, and the land itself.

## Contributions

I started collaborating in the project in the fall of 2025, with the purpose of assisting the team in the research and development process. Current contributions (all ongoing work) include: 

- [*Bayt wa Balad* project bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6331652/bayt-wa-balad/library): the bibliography compiles references we gathered. It covers the wide range of topics of the project, such as: mapping and counter-mapping, Palestinian heritage, maps and data portals, decolonial museum practices, visual narratives and storytelling for cultural collections

- [Literature review](./lit-review/index): the literature review is a derived research outcome from the bibliography. By highlighting key references we found in the literature, it aims to point to good practices that apply to our approach or identify challenges we might encounter in the making of *Bayt wa Balad*.
  The review is divided into three themes: 

  - [Mapping](./lit-review/mapping)
  - [Cataloging](./lit-review/cataloging)
  - [Storytelling](./lit-review/storytelling)

- [Project framework](): The framework documents *Bayt wa Balad* R&D questions, challenges and decisions. Its structure mimics the literature review, to provide efficient parallels and sustain links with the existing research and projects:

  - [Mapping](./framework/mapping)
  - [Cataloging](./framework/cataloging)
  - [Storytelling](./framework/storytelling)

- Object prototypes: the *Bayt wa Balad* team is collectively working towards the first prototypes. They are StoryMaps focusing on specific objects in the collection, merging in-depth research with geo/visual enhancements.
